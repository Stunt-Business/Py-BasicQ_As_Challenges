# Subject : Challenge III - Guess the number
#----------------------------------------------------
# what would be the output of this program ?

'''

    Let the user guess the number you have just generated.
    Your  number should be generated between 0 and 10.

    if the value entered is higher  than the number
    let the user know so that the user can reduce its value
    for the next attempt.

    if the value entered is lower than the number
    let the user know so that the user can increase its
    value.

    Give 5 attemps to the user.
    If the user fails to find the number,
    ask the user if he wants to stop.

    If the user enter yes, stop program.
